# Breast Cancer Detection

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Breast Cancer Detection.ipynb`) that demonstrates the implementation of a machine learning model for detecting breast cancer based on medical data. The project uses various data preprocessing techniques and evaluation metrics to achieve accurate predictions.
