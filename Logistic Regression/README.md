Titanic Survival Prediction System
Developed a survival prediction system for the Titanic dataset using Logistic Regression. The system involved preprocessing and analyzing the data with Pandas and visualizing missing values, distributions, and patterns with Seaborn. Missing values in the Age column were filled based on Pclass, while the Cabin column was dropped due to excessive null values. Categorical features such as Sex and Embarked were encoded using one-hot encoding. The data was split into training and testing sets using train_test_split, and a Logistic Regression model was trained with scikit-learn. The model's performance was evaluated using a classification report and confusion matrix, showcasing its accuracy in predicting passenger survival.

Advertisement Click Prediction System
Developed a prediction system using Logistic Regression to determine whether a user will click on an advertisement based on their features. The project utilized a dataset containing user demographics and online activity metrics, including Age, Daily Internet Usage, and Area Income. The system involved data exploration and visualization with Seaborn to identify trends and relationships among features. Irrelevant columns were removed, and categorical features like Country were encoded using one-hot encoding. The data was split into training and testing sets using train_test_split. A Logistic Regression model was trained using scikit-learn, and its performance was evaluated through a classification report and confusion matrix, demonstrating its accuracy in predicting user behavior.
