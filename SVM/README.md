The dataset for the Breast Cancer Detection was imported using sklearn's datasets.
Normal SVC was applied first and then a grid search was performed to find the most optimal values for the parameters i.e c & gamma. The results were compared using classification report and confusion matrix.


The dataset for the Iris project was taken from Seaborn and was used to predict the specie of the Iris flower with the help of SVC (Support Vector Classifier).
Normal SVC was applied first and then a grid search was performed to find the most optimal values for the parameters i.e c & gamma. The results were compared using classification report and confusion matrix.
